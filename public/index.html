          <h3>Rails against the Machine!<span> April 10th, 2017</span></h3>
          <p>Here we are, the beginning of week 5 at The Iron Yard. We have sailed through so many different programs, and gems, at a speed that would give anyone whiplash, all leading up to Rails. We finally made it! Last Thursday we began building our first Rails powered web application. And just like that, in the blink of an eye nearly everything we learned in the last 4 weeks, all of that code we wrote, all of those hours spent making it all come together, all of it, no longer necessary! Everything we had learned to build on our own, every line of code, it was all there. All it took was a couple of commands in terminal and like magic it all appeared.</p>

        <h3>JavaScript, At first glance…<span> April 26th, 2017</span></h3>
        <p>Today is week 7, day 3, of the 12 week program in Ruby on Rails. During lecture we were introduced to JavaScript for the first time. Until now, we have been furiously learning Ruby on Rails in bites that would seem impossible to swallow, and yet somehow the information is sticking. Why would we be learning anything about JavaScript? Isn’t one programming language enough? The thing is, as back-end developers, we are going to need to be able to speak to the front-end, and more specifically as Ruby on Rails developers we need to be conversant in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. </p>
